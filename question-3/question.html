    Given the great media resonance and wide audience they reach, relevant
    events are more likely to generate both positive debate and opportunities
    for falsification. In this scenario, it is interesting to highlight the
    possible creation and dissemination of visual misinformation about an event
    and the response to it, which is translated into the number of sites that
    declare an image false. At the same time, the aim is to study whether the
    awareness of the phenomenon has increased over time and whether specific
    types of events are more subject to debunking.

    <p>
      Among the relevant events, those with no debunked false images - such as
      Ferguson Shooting, Palestinian Refugees in Syria, Israel Assault and
      others - are fewer in number than those with false images declared fake.

      The number of debunked images has significantly increased through the
      years. In 2014 there are 31 images officially declared false, while in
      2019 there are 82. In addition, 2019 was the year in which individual
      images were debunked more times than in any other year.

    <p>
      Most images have been debunked less than 16 times: this is the starting
      point for an exponential increase of the debunking phenomenon. Only 7
      photos exceed this threshold: therefore only in rare cases many sites were
      active in declaring false the same image en masse.

      The image declared false the most (45 times) is the one representing a
      shark on a highway linked to the Hurricane Harvey catastrophe, which is
      also one of the most absurd photos.
