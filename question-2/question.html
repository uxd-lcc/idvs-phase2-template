  Given the great media resonance and wide audience they reach, relevant events
  are more likely to generate both positive debate and opportunities for
  falsification. In this scenario, it is interesting to highlight the possible
  creation and dissemination of visual misinformation about an event and the
  response to it, which is translated into the number of sites that declare an
  image false. At the same time, the aim is to study whether the awareness of
  the phenomenon has increased over time and whether specific types of events
  are more subject to debunking.

<div class="main-text-title"><h3>Main findings</h3></div>
<div class="main-text">
  <p>
    Among the relevant events, those with no debunked false images - such as
    Ferguson Shooting, Palestinian Refugees in Syria, Israel Assault and others
    - are fewer in number than those with false images declared fake.

    The number of debunked images has significantly increased through the years.
    In 2014 there are 31 images officially declared false, while in 2019 there
    are 82. In addition, 2019 was the year in which individual images were
    debunked more times than in any other year.

    Most images have been debunked less than 16 times: this is the starting
    point for an exponential increase of the debunking phenomenon. Only 7 photos
    exceed this threshold: therefore only in rare cases many sites were active
    in declaring false the same image en masse.

    The image declared false the most (45 times) is the one representing a shark
    on a highway linked to the Hurricane Harvey catastrophe, which is also one
    of the most absurd photos.
