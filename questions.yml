  title: Debunked images of the last 6 years debunked on Google.com
  description: Given the great media resonance and wide audience they reach, relevant events are more likely to generate both positive debate and opportunities for falsification.

At the same time, the aim is to study whether the awareness of the phenomenon has increased over time and whether specific types of events are more subject to debunking.
